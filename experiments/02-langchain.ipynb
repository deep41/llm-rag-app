      "Question: What is the purpose of the course?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, the purpose of the course appears to be teaching students practical skills and insights to build machine learning systems that work in real-world scenarios. The course aims to provide students with hands-on experience through live, interactive sessions, step-by-step coding instructions, and access to complete source code of a production system. Additionally, the course offers support from the community and direct feedback from the instructor to help students learn and grow.\n",
      "Question: How many hours of live sessions?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the context provided, there are 18 hours of live sessions in the program.\n",
      "Question: How many coding assignments are there in the program?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the context provided, there are 100 coding assignments in the program.\n",
      "Question: Is there a program certificate upon completion?\n",
      "Answer: Yes, upon completion of the program, you will receive a program certificate.\n",
      "Question: What programming language will be used in the program?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the context provided, the programming language that will be used in the program is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the content of the documents provided, it seems that Python is the primary language used for teaching machine learning concepts and building projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Document 1, there is a mention of using \"best practices to tackle the most significant challenges machine learning engineers face,\" which suggests that the program will cover practical aspects of building machine learning systems. In Document 2, there is a section on \"Creating Training, Deploying, Monitoring, and Inference Pipelines\" using Amazon SageMaker and open-source tools, which further reinforces the use of Python for building production-ready models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Python will likely be the primary programming language used in the program.\n",
